Pebble App - VandyHacksII

Streak is an Android + Pebble app that incentivizes users to be healthy, by regularly logging their meals and working out. A common problem many users face with fitness apps is that they have to remember to log a meal, or to log their workout. Streak handles that!<br>
As soon as the app senses that you are at your designated gym, Streak knows you've worked out and adds another day to your ongoing streak. Eating out? Streak recognizes that and will remind you on the Pebble to log your meal.

The longer you're healthy for, the better the reward. Set goals, and compete with friends. But if you break your streak however, you're paying for your friends' rewards.
